      <h3>Seb Chan</h3>
      <p> I've been programming since Year 10 when I took Computer Science as one of my GCSE's.
          All the way through GCSE and A-Levels I have only ever programmed in Python, and at times found
          it hard to adjust during bootcamp but I eventually got the hang of it. When I'm not struggling
          with coding or at work, I am usually playing games or watching Arsenal play.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Guess the Song</h3>
    <p>
        For my programming project I decided to make a sort of quiz game, where you would have to guess the name of
        the song by just listening to the instrumental. Inititally I wanted to recreate the instrumenals myself, 
        however I quickly realised that I was definitely not capable of doing that in the slightest.
